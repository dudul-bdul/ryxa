## 關於我

是一個失敗的人。  
熱愛學習各種新事物，但什麼都不專精。  
人生不會重來，活得開心最重要!

從來沒想過要成功。  
因為只有魯蛇才會天天想要成功; 為了當一個成功的魯蛇。

雖然，在這找不到成功；但，成功最終會回來找他媽的。

## About Me

A failure: Mother of success.  
Love to learn new stuff. Master of none.  
Having fun is all it matters. YOLO!

Never seeking success.  
That’s all a loser hope for; A successful loser.

### A Little Story

> - What is your greatest failure, and what did you learn from it?
> - Tell me about a time you were successful?

The above questions are frequently asked during interviews. These questions help interviewers analyze the behavior of interviewees.

However, it only makes sense if the questions were asked from qualified individuals. If you have worked with qualified brilliant interviewers, you can totally tell the differences.

Some incompetent interviewers have neither related background knowledge nor sufficient experience to analyze behavior from interviewees. The reason they asked those questions was only because other interviewers at top end companies have done it.

You trusted their professionalism, but they judged your definition of success and failure. They looked at you with undisguised contempt and showed you no respect. Later, you find out that with their level of education background and experience, it is absurd that you were scorned.

The truth is that any person could split out the same questions pretending to be professional. One can just sit there being ignorantly arrogant and acting superior only because he/she already have his/her butt on that position.

What a waste of resource and time! What a shame!

So, I would say...

Just let those incompetent people judge all they want with their uneducated and flawed guesses.

Do not let them intimidate you. What can you expect from a dog but a bark?

Whatever they say, you do not prove a person wrong by cutting out his/her tongue. Moreover, you have nothing to prove to anyone.

Your value shall never be judged by external validation.

Just do your best all the time and try to exceed yourself. Be proud of yourself and be humble to others.

Here is a motivational video for you:
